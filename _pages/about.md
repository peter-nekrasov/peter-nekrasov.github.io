I am a PhD student in the Committee for Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago. 

My research uses tools from numerical and applied analysis to study the dynamics of ice sheets and other fluid interfaces. My recent work involves developing and analyzing integral equation formulations for surface wave PDEs. This class of problems involves nonlocal terms and complicated boundary conditions, leading to a rich collection of wave scattering phenomena with important implications for ice-sheet stability.
